# BeeHave

BeeHave is a classroom management app developed as part of the final project at the Apple Developer Academy.  Tasked with using the Challenge Based Learning framework to identify a significant problem, conduct thorough research, and create a feasible and desirable solution, our team focused on addressing the challenges teachers face in managing student behavior.  The project went from idea to launch on TestFlight, aiming to deliver a practical tool that enhances the teaching experience.
